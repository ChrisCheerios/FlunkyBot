This Section Describes the different chess AI's accessible on the platform.

Note: To assign earlier versions of flunkyBOT to sides in a game, type 'flunkybotv1.0' or 'flunkybotv1.1' when prompted to assign sides.


**ChaosBOT**

    ChaosBOT is a chess 'engine' that moves entirely randomly.  It selects uniformly from a set of all legal moves.

    It tends to move the Queen a lot, simply because the queen tends to have many legal moves in any position.
    It also considers a pawn promoting to a queen, bishop, knight, and rook as four distinct moves- meaning both that
    ChaosBOT is much 4x likelier to move a pawn on the 7th rank than one on the 6th and that Chaosbot is just as likely
    to promote to a knight as a queen!





**FlunkyBOT**

Version 1.0:    The first functioning version of flunkybot maximizes the material difference (wht I'll callmaterial delta) at a search depth of 1 half-move.
                In other words, it considers each legal move from the current position and chooses the move that maximizes its material count relative to its
                opponent.  Because it only searches at depth of 1 half-move, this is equivalent to 'always capturing the highest value piece it can' with no
                regard for check, checkmate, stalemate, or countercaptures.  If two moves are equivalent the material delta, flunkybot chooses sorta-randomly.

                Against ChaosBOT: Wins ~75% of games against ChaosBOT, draws ~25% (Flunky gets a huge material advantage, but sometimes it accidentally stalemates before checkmating)

Version 1.1:    Still look at a depth of 1 half-move, but with the benefit of identifying stalemates and check.  It will always execute a checkmate, and will
                assign positive value to stalemates if it is behind and negative value if it is ahead.

                Against ChaosBOT:  Wins nearly 100% of games against ChaosBOT ()
                Against FlunkyBOTv1:  Draws about 70%.  Wins almost 30%. (They usually aggressively exchange material until it's all off the board.  Then have a 50 move stalemate)

Version 1.2:    Introduced a system of weighing the value of a piece by the number of attackers/defenders on it.  For example a queen (usually rated at 9 'points') that is left hanging
                will suffer a value multiplier of .7, bringing its 'value' down to 6.3.  If the same queen is under a direct threat, it's rating drops even further, to 2.7.  This weighting
                technique is a relatively simple way to 'teach' flunkyBOT not to make totally braindead exchanges and to actually value piece safety.

                This version is much, much, much stronger than any previous version.  I'd ballpark it's has a rating of about 650 in the real world.  Which isn't good, but it is something!

                Against ChaosBOT: ~100% winrate
                Against Flunkybotv1.0:  Unknown
                Against Flunkybotv1.1: 95% winrate, 5% draw/lose rate
